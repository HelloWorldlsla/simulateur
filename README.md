2D collision engine

This is a simple collision engine built for a school project. Some elements are written in french because it was designed to be readable for physician that reviewed my work, which happen to speak in french.

The software is under the GPL verison 3.
FontAwesome's font is used int the directory src/main/resources. Please look at https://fontawesome.com if you want to know more about this font.
It was taken from https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/get-started/ with the license SIL OFL 1.1. Please look at https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/license/ for more details.


This project was built using Java with Maven build system. A translation into C or maybe in RUST with the Vulkan API will be made in the futur to increase the performance and to reduce the dependancies. Please note that this project will still be alive and contribution is welcome.

This software has some bugs at the moment, including text that gets printed where it shouldn't and some issues with the top-right panel that sometimes show the buttons in a wrong order.
In fact, all text elements are not scaled with the DPI. This means that resizing the window can cause text to move around.

If you find any other issue or suggestion, please leave a message in the ISSUES tab above.

King regards,
